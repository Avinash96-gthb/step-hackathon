### High-Level Functional Flow
1. **Song Addition**: User adds song → InstantLookupEngine stores in HashMap → PlaylistEngine adds to DoublyLinkedList
2. **Song Playback**: User plays song → PlaybackHistoryEngine pushes to Stack → AutoReplayEngine tracks play count
3. **Song Rating**: User rates song → SongRatingEngine inserts into BST with O(log n) complexity
4. **Playlist Operations**: User sorts/shuffles → SortingEngine applies merge/quick sort algorithms
5. **Dashboard Analytics**: SystemDashboardEngine aggregates data from all engines using multiple data structures
6. **Skip Tracking**: User skips song → RecentlySkippedTracker adds to circular Queue buffer
7. **Auto-Replay**: Playlist ends → AutoReplayEngine selects top 3 calming songs using HashMap and Priority Queue logic

## 4. Core Feature-wise Implementation

### Feature: Playlist Engine using Linked Lists

**Scenario Brief**  
Users need to create dynamic playlists where songs can be efficiently added, removed, reordered, or reversed without the overhead of array shifting operations.

**Data Structures Used**  
- **Doubly Linked List**: Custom implementation with forward and backward pointers
- **Node Structure**: Contains song data, next, and previous pointers

**Time and Space Complexity**
- `addSong()`: O(1) at head/tail, O(n) at specific position
- `deleteSong()`: O(n) for traversal to index
- `moveSong()`: O(n) for traversal, O(1) for pointer manipulation
- `reversePlaylist()`: O(n) single pass reversal
- Space Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of songs

**Sample Input & Output**
```
Input: addSong("Bohemian Rhapsody", "Queen", 355)
Output: Song added at position 0, playlist size: 1

Input: moveSong(0, 2) 
Output: Song moved successfully, new order maintained

Input: reversePlaylist()
Output: Playlist reversed, 5 songs reordered
```

**Code Snippet**
```typescript
/**
 * Add song to playlist at specific position
 * Time Complexity: O(n) - linked list insertion
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
 */
addSongToPlaylist(songId: string, position?: number): boolean {
  const song = this.getSong(songId);
  if (!song) return false;
  
  return this.playlistEngine.addSong(song, position);
}

/**
 * Move song within playlist
 * Time Complexity: O(n) - linked list operations
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
 */
moveSongInPlaylist(fromIndex: number, toIndex: number): boolean {
  return this.playlistEngine.moveSong(fromIndex, toIndex);
}
```

**Challenges Faced & How You Solved Them**  
- **Challenge**: Maintaining pointer integrity during complex move operations
- **Solution**: Implemented careful pointer manipulation with null checks and edge case handling for head/tail operations

---

### Feature: Playback History using Stack

**Scenario Brief**  
Users need "undo" functionality to restore recently played songs back to the current playlist, implementing LIFO behavior for music controls.

**Data Structures Used**  
- **Stack**: Custom implementation with LIFO operations
- **PlayedSong Interface**: Contains song object, timestamp, and playlist position

**Time and Space Complexity**
- `playSong()`: O(1) - stack push operation
- `undoLastPlay()`: O(1) - stack pop operation
- `getHistory()`: O(n) - traverse entire history
- Space Complexity: O(h) where h is the history size limit

**Sample Input & Output**
```
Input: playSong("song123")
Output: Song played and added to history stack

Input: undoLastPlay()
Output: Last played song restored to playlist at original position

Input: getHistory(5)
Output: Returns last 5 played songs in LIFO order
```

**Code Snippet**
```typescript
/**
 * Play a song and track it in history
 * Time Complexity: O(1) - stack push + hash map updates
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
 */
playSong(songId: string): boolean {
  const song = this.getSong(songId);
  if (!song) return false;

  const position = this.getCurrentPlaylist().findIndex(s => s.id === songId);
  this.playbackHistoryEngine.playSong(song, position);
  this.autoReplayEngine.trackPlay(song);
  
  return true;
}

/**
 * Undo last played song
 * Time Complexity: O(1) - stack pop
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
 */
undoLastPlay(): Song | null {
  return this.playbackHistoryEngine.undoLastPlay();
}
```

**Challenges Faced & How You Solved Them**  
- **Challenge**: Synchronizing playlist positions when undoing plays
- **Solution**: Stored original playlist position with each played song to enable accurate restoration

---

### Feature: Song Rating Tree using Binary Search Tree

**Scenario Brief**  
Fast insertion, deletion, and search of songs by user rating (1-5 stars) to enable efficient recommendation systems and rating-based filtering.

**Data Structures Used**  
- **Binary Search Tree**: Custom implementation with rating-based organization
- **Rating Buckets**: Each BST node contains an array of songs with the same rating
- **In-order Traversal**: For sorted rating retrieval

**Time and Space Complexity**
- `insertSong()`: O(log n) average, O(n) worst case
- `searchByRating()`: O(log n) average for tree traversal
- `deleteSong()`: O(log n) average for search + removal
- `getRecommendedSongs()`: O(k log k) where k is recommended songs count
- Space Complexity: O(n) where n is total number of rated songs

**Sample Input & Output**
```
Input: rateSong("song123", 4.5)
Output: Song rated 4.5 stars, inserted into BST at rating node 4

Input: getSongsByRating(5)
Output: Returns all 5-star rated songs [song1, song3, song7]

Input: getRecommendedSongs(10)
Output: Returns top 10 highest-rated songs sorted by rating
```

**Code Snippet**
```typescript
/**
 * Rate a song and insert into BST
 * Time Complexity: O(log n) average - BST insertion
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
 */
rateSong(songId: string, rating: number): boolean {
  if (rating < 1 || rating > 5) return false;
  
  const song = this.getSong(songId);
  if (!song) return false;
  
  return this.songRatingEngine.insertSong(song, rating);
}

/**
 * Get songs by rating
 * Time Complexity: O(log n) average - BST search
 * Space Complexity: O(k) where k is the number of songs with that rating
 */
getSongsByRating(rating: number): Song[] {
  return this.songRatingEngine.searchByRating(rating);
}
```

**Challenges Faced & How You Solved Them**  
- **Challenge**: Handling multiple songs with the same rating efficiently
- **Solution**: Implemented rating buckets where each BST node contains an array of songs, enabling multiple songs per rating level

---

### Feature: Instant Song Lookup using HashMap

**Scenario Brief**  
When users search by song title or ID, the system must return song metadata in O(1) time for real-time search experiences.

**Data Structures Used**  
- **HashMap**: Custom implementation with collision handling via chaining
- **Dual Indexing**: Separate hash maps for song ID and title lookups
- **Load Factor Management**: Automatic resizing when load factor exceeds threshold

**Time and Space Complexity**
- `addSong()`: O(1) average - hash map insertion
- `getSong()`: O(1) average, O(n) worst case with collisions
- `searchByTitle()`: O(1) average for exact match
- `removeSong()`: O(1) average - hash map deletion
- Space Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of songs

**Sample Input & Output**
```
Input: addSong({id: "song123", title: "Bohemian Rhapsody"})
Output: Song indexed in both ID and title hash maps

Input: getSong("song123")
Output: Returns complete song object in O(1) time

Input: searchByTitle("Bohemian")
Output: Returns song with matching title instantly
```

**Code Snippet**
```typescript
/**
 * Add song to lookup system
 * Time Complexity: O(1) average - hash map insertion
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
 */
addSong(song: Song): void {
  this.instantLookupEngine.addSong(song);
  // Sync with other engines
  this.songRatingEngine.addSong(song);
}

/**
 * Get song by ID
 * Time Complexity: O(1) average - hash map lookup
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
 */
getSong(songId: string): Song | null {
  return this.instantLookupEngine.getSong(songId);
}
```

**Challenges Faced & How You Solved Them**  
- **Challenge**: Maintaining synchronization between multiple data structures when songs are added/removed
- **Solution**: Implemented centralized song management in PlayWiseEngine that updates all relevant data structures atomically

---

### Feature: Time-based Sorting using Merge/Quick Sort

**Scenario Brief**  
Users can sort playlists by various criteria (title, duration, date added) with multiple sorting algorithms to compare performance characteristics.

**Data Structures Used**  
- **Merge Sort**: Stable sort with guaranteed O(n log n) performance
- **Quick Sort**: In-place sort with average O(n log n) performance
- **Heap Sort**: Additional sorting option with O(n log n) worst-case guarantee
- **Comparator Functions**: Custom comparison logic for different sort criteria

**Time and Space Complexity**
- `mergeSort()`: O(n log n) time, O(n) space
- `quickSort()`: O(n log n) average, O(n²) worst case, O(log n) space
- `heapSort()`: O(n log n) time, O(1) space
- `sortPlaylist()`: Depends on chosen algorithm

**Sample Input & Output**
```
Input: sortPlaylist({field: "duration", order: "asc"}, "merge")
Output: Playlist sorted by duration using merge sort in 15ms

Input: sortPlaylist({field: "title", order: "desc"}, "quick")
Output: Playlist sorted alphabetically (descending) using quick sort

Input: toggleSortCriteria("recently_added")
Output: Playlist re-sorted by date added, newest first
```

**Code Snippet**
```typescript
/**
 * Sort playlist by criteria
 * Time Complexity: O(n log n) - sorting algorithm
 * Space Complexity: O(n)
 */
sortPlaylist(criteria: SortCriteria, algorithm: 'merge' | 'quick' = 'merge'): boolean {
  return this.playlistEngine.sortPlaylist(criteria, algorithm);
}

/**
 * Merge sort implementation
 * Time Complexity: O(n log n)
 * Space Complexity: O(n)
 */
private mergeSort<T>(arr: T[], compare: (a: T, b: T) => number): T[] {
  if (arr.length <= 1) return arr;
  
  const mid = Math.floor(arr.length / 2);
  const left = this.mergeSort(arr.slice(0, mid), compare);
  const right = this.mergeSort(arr.slice(mid), compare);
  
  return this.merge(left, right, compare);
}
```

**Challenges Faced & How You Solved Them**  
- **Challenge**: Comparing performance between different sorting algorithms on varying data sizes
- **Solution**: Implemented benchmarking functionality that measures execution time and memory usage for different algorithms and data sets

 */
private optimizedSwap(nodeA: Node<T>, nodeB: Node<T>): void {
  // Swap data without node recreation - O(1) operation
  const tempData = nodeA.data;
  nodeA.data = nodeB.data;
  nodeB.data = tempData;
}

/**

## 5. Additional Use Case Implementation

### Use Case: Auto Replay Based on Genre Mood

**Scenario Brief**  
For calming genres like "Lo-Fi" or "Jazz", automatically loop the top 3 most-played songs once the playlist ends, creating a seamless mood-based listening experience.

**Extension Over Which Core Feature**  
Extends the **Playback History** and **Instant Song Lookup** features by adding intelligent replay logic based on genre classification and play count tracking.

**New Data Structures or Logic Used**  
- **HashMap for Play Count Tracking**: `songId → playCount` mapping for O(1) access
- **Genre Classification HashMap**: `songId → genre` for fast genre lookups
- **Priority Queue Logic**: Top-k selection algorithm for finding most-played songs
- **Calming Genre Detection**: Configurable array of mood-based genre classifications

**Sample Input & Output**
```
Input: Playlist ends with last song being "Lo-Fi Hip Hop"
Processing: AutoReplayEngine identifies calming genre, finds top 3 most-played lo-fi songs
Output: Automatically starts playing top 3 most-played calming songs in sequence

Input: trackPlay({id: "song123", genre: "jazz"})
Output: Play count incremented, song classified as calming genre

Input: getReplaySongs()
Output: ["Chill Jazz #1" (15 plays), "Smooth Jazz" (12 plays), "Night Jazz" (10 plays)]
```

**Code Snippet**
```typescript
/**
 * Auto-replay based on genre mood
 * Time Complexity: O(n log n) for sorting by play count
 * Space Complexity: O(n) for calming songs collection
 */
getReplaySongs(): Song[] {
  const calmingSongs: Array<{ song: Song; playCount: number }> = [];
  
  // Filter calming genres using HashMap lookup - O(n)
  for (const [songId, genre] of this.songGenreMap.entries()) {
    if (this.isCalmingGenre(genre)) {
      const song = this.songObjectMap.get(songId);
      const playCount = this.songPlayCounts.get(songId) || 0;
      
      if (song && playCount > 0) {
        calmingSongs.push({ song, playCount });
      }
    }
  }
  
  // Sort by play count and return top 3 - O(n log n)
  calmingSongs.sort((a, b) => b.playCount - a.playCount);
  return calmingSongs.slice(0, 3).map(item => item.song);
}
```

**Challenges Faced & Resolution**  
- **Challenge**: Determining which genres qualify as "calming" and handling edge cases when no calming songs are available
- **Resolution**: Implemented configurable genre classification with fallback logic to general top-played songs when calming songs are insufficient

---

### Use Case: Recently Skipped Tracker

**Scenario Brief**  
Keep a record of the last 10 skipped songs to prevent them from being replayed in auto-play mode, improving user experience by avoiding recently rejected content.

**Extension Over Which Core Feature**  
Extends the **Auto Replay** and **Playback History** features by adding skip tracking intelligence to the song selection algorithms.

**New Data Structures or Logic Used**  
- **Circular Queue (Deque)**: Fixed-size buffer maintaining last 10 skipped songs
- **Sliding Window Logic**: Automatic overflow handling when skip limit is reached
- **Skip Count HashMap**: `songId → totalSkipCount` for analytics
- **Time-based Filtering**: Optional filtering based on skip timestamp

**Sample Input & Output**
```
Input: skipSong("song123")
Output: Song added to skip tracker, removed from auto-replay consideration

Input: filterOutRecentlySkipped([song1, song2, song3]) where song2 was recently skipped
Output: [song1, song3] - recently skipped songs filtered out

Input: getMostSkippedSongs(5)
Output: Top 5 most frequently skipped songs with skip counts
```

**Code Snippet**
```typescript
/**
 * Track skipped song with sliding window behavior
 * Time Complexity: O(1) - queue enqueue with fixed size
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - fixed-size circular buffer
 */
trackSkip(song: Song): void {
  const skippedSong: SkippedSong = {
    song,
    skippedAt: new Date()
  };

  // Maintain sliding window of last 10 skips
  const removedSong = this.skippedQueue.isFull() ? this.skippedQueue.peek() : null;
  this.skippedQueue.enqueue(skippedSong);

  // Update skip count analytics
  const currentCount = this.skipCountMap.get(song.id) || 0;
  this.skipCountMap.set(song.id, currentCount + 1);
}

/**
 * Filter out recently skipped songs
 * Time Complexity: O(m) where m is songs to filter
 * Space Complexity: O(k) where k is skip history size
 */
filterOutRecentlySkipped(songs: Song[]): Song[] {
  const recentlySkippedIds = new Set<string>();
  
  for (const skippedSong of this.skippedQueue.toArray()) {
    recentlySkippedIds.add(skippedSong.song.id);
  }
  
  return songs.filter(song => !recentlySkippedIds.has(song.id));
}
```

**Challenges Faced & Resolution**  
- **Challenge**: Efficiently maintaining skip count accuracy when using circular buffer with automatic overflow
- **Resolution**: Implemented dual tracking system with queue for recent skips and HashMap for total skip counts, with careful synchronization during buffer overflow

    averageSessionLength: 45.5,
    mostSkippedGenre: "metal",
    preferredListeningTime: "evening"
  },
  songPerformance: {
    topPerformers: [song1, song2, song3],
    underperformers: [song4, song5],
    ratingTrends: "increasing"
  },
  systemMetrics: {
    responseTime: 0.8,
    memoryUsage: 45.2,
    operationEfficiency: 0.95
  }
}
```

**Code Snippet**
```typescript
/**
 * Advanced analytics with multi-engine data integration
 * Time Complexity: O(n log n) for complex aggregations
 * Space Complexity: O(n) for analytical data storage
 */
getAdvancedAnalytics(): AdvancedAnalytics {
  return {
    userBehavior: this.analyzeUserBehavior(),
    songPerformance: this.analyzeSongPerformance(),
    systemMetrics: this.analyzeSystemPerformance(),
    realTimeMetrics: this.getLiveMetrics()
  };
}

/**
 * Live system performance monitoring
 * Integrates performance data from all data structures
 */
getLiveMetrics(): LiveMetrics {
  const startTime = performance.now();
  
  const metrics = {
    activeOperations: this.getActiveOperationCount(),
    memoryFootprint: this.calculateTotalMemoryUsage(),
    operationLatency: this.measureAverageLatency(),
    dataStructureEfficiency: this.analyzeDataStructurePerformance()
  };
  
  const endTime = performance.now();
  metrics.metricsComputationTime = endTime - startTime;
  
  return metrics;
}
```

**Challenges Faced & Resolution**  
- **Challenge**: Computing real-time analytics without impacting main application performance
- **Resolution**: Implemented background computation with caching strategies and incremental updates, ensuring analytics processing doesn't block primary music operations
