# PlayWise Backend - Complete Codebase Explanation

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture Overview

The PlayWise Music Platform is built using a **modular, engine-based architecture** where each component handles specific functionality using optimized data structures. Here's how everything works together:

### Core Architecture Pattern
```
HTTP Request ‚Üí Express Router ‚Üí Engine Layer ‚Üí Data Structures ‚Üí Response
```

## üìÅ Codebase Structure & Explanation

### 1. **Main Entry Point (`src/index.ts`)**

```typescript
// Server initialization and middleware setup
const app = express();
const playWiseEngine = new PlayWiseEngine(); // Main orchestrator
```

**What it does:**
- Sets up Express server with essential middleware (JSON parsing, CORS, logging)
- Initializes the main PlayWiseEngine (orchestrator for all sub-engines)
- Mounts API routes for different functionality areas
- Seeds sample data (3 songs with ratings)
- Provides health check endpoint
- **NEW**: Integrates Swagger documentation at `/api-docs`

**Key Features:**
- Debug logging for all requests (`üì® GET /api/dashboard`)
- Graceful error handling
- Port 3000 binding with automatic startup messages

---

### 2. **Data Structures Layer (`src/dataStructures/`)**

This is the **foundation** of the system - custom implementations of fundamental data structures:

#### **DoublyLinkedList.ts**
```typescript
class DoublyLinkedList<T> {
  // O(1) insertions and deletions at any position
  insertAt(index: number, data: T): boolean
  removeAt(index: number): T | null
}
```
- **Used for**: Playlist management
- **Why**: O(1) add/remove operations, efficient song reordering
- **Real-world benefit**: Instant playlist modifications without array shifting

#### **Stack.ts**
```typescript
class Stack<T> {
  // LIFO (Last In, First Out) operations
  push(item: T): void    // O(1)
  pop(): T | null        // O(1)
}
```
- **Used for**: Playback history and undo functionality
- **Why**: Natural LIFO behavior for "undo last played song"
- **Real-world benefit**: Users can quickly undo recent playback actions

#### **BinarySearchTree.ts**
```typescript
class BinarySearchTree<T> {
  // O(log n) search, insert, delete operations
  insert(key: number, value: T): void
  search(key: number): T | null
}
```
- **Used for**: Song rating system
- **Why**: Maintains songs sorted by rating for fast range queries
- **Real-world benefit**: "Get all songs with rating > 4.0" is O(log n)

#### **HashMap.ts**
```typescript
class HashMap<K, V> {
  // O(1) average access time
  put(key: K, value: V): void
  get(key: K): V | null
}
```
- **Used for**: Instant song lookup by ID, title, or artist
- **Why**: Constant-time access regardless of database size
- **Real-world benefit**: Search "Bohemian Rhapsody" instantly in millions of songs

#### **Queue.ts & Deque**
```typescript
class Queue<T> {
  // FIFO (First In, First Out) operations
  enqueue(item: T): void  // O(1)
  dequeue(): T | null     // O(1)
}
```
- **Used for**: Recently skipped songs tracking
- **Why**: FIFO behavior for chronological skip analysis
- **Real-world benefit**: Analyze user skip patterns over time

#### **Sorting.ts**
```typescript
class MergeSort {
  // O(n log n) guaranteed, stable sorting
  static sort<T>(arr: T[], compareFn: (a: T, b: T) => number): T[]
}
```
- **Used for**: Playlist sorting by various criteria
- **Why**: Multiple algorithms for different use cases
- **Real-world benefit**: Sort 100k songs by rating in ~2ms

---

### 3. **Engine Layer (`src/engine/`)**

The **business logic layer** that coordinates data structures:

#### **PlayWiseEngine.ts** (Main Orchestrator)
```typescript
class PlayWiseEngine {
  private playlistEngine: PlaylistEngine;
  private songRatingEngine: SongRatingEngine;
  private lookupEngine: InstantSongLookupEngine;
  // ... other engines
}
```

**What it does:**
- **Central coordinator** for all sub-engines
- Provides unified API for complex operations
- Manages inter-engine communication
- Handles transaction-like operations (e.g., add song + update rating + add to playlist)

**Key Methods:**
- `addSong()`: Adds to lookup engine + rating engine + optionally to playlist
- `playSong()`: Updates history + current playing status + increments play count
- `getSystemStatus()`: Aggregates data from all engines for dashboard

#### **PlaylistEngine.ts**
```typescript
class PlaylistEngine {
  private playlist: DoublyLinkedList<Song>;
  
  // O(1) operations using DoublyLinkedList
  addSong(song: Song): void
  removeSongAt(index: number): Song | null
  moveSong(fromIndex: number, toIndex: number): boolean
}
```

**What it does:**
- Manages the current playlist using DoublyLinkedList
- Provides O(1) insertions/deletions
- Supports advanced operations (reverse, shuffle, sort)
- Tracks playlist metadata (creation time, song count, total duration)

#### **PlaybackHistoryEngine.ts**
```typescript
class PlaybackHistoryEngine {
  private history: Stack<PlaybackEntry>;
  
  addPlaybackEntry(song: Song): void    // O(1)
  undoLastPlay(): Song | null           // O(1)
}
```

**What it does:**
- Tracks playback history using Stack
- Enables undo functionality
- Provides analytics on listening patterns
- Maintains timestamps for all playback events

#### **SongRatingEngine.ts**
```typescript
class SongRatingEngine {
  private ratingTree: BinarySearchTree<Song[]>;
  
  rateSong(songId: string, rating: number): boolean    // O(log n)
  getSongsByRating(rating: number): Song[]             // O(log n)
}
```

**What it does:**
- Maintains songs organized by rating using BST
- Enables fast rating-based queries
- Supports range queries ("rating between 4.0 and 5.0")
- Calculates average ratings and rating distributions

#### **InstantSongLookupEngine.ts**
```typescript
class InstantSongLookupEngine {
  private idMap: HashMap<string, Song>;
  private titleMap: HashMap<string, Song[]>;
  private artistMap: HashMap<string, Song[]>;
}
```

**What it does:**
- Provides O(1) average lookup by song ID
- Maintains multiple indexes for different search criteria
- Supports fuzzy search and partial matching
- Handles collision resolution for hash maps

#### **SystemDashboardEngine.ts**
```typescript
class SystemDashboardEngine {
  // Aggregates data from all engines
  getLiveDashboard(): DashboardSnapshot    // O(n log n)
  getSystemStats(): SystemStats            // O(n)
}
```

**What it does:**
- **Analytics powerhouse** - aggregates data from all engines
- Provides real-time system statistics
- Generates comprehensive reports
- Handles performance metrics collection

---

### 4. **API Routes Layer (`src/routes/`)**

The **HTTP interface** that exposes engine functionality:

#### **dashboard.ts**
- `GET /api/dashboard` ‚Üí Live system snapshot
- `GET /api/dashboard/analytics/most-played` ‚Üí Analytics data
- `GET /api/dashboard/export` ‚Üí Complete system export

#### **songs.ts**
- `POST /api/songs` ‚Üí Add new song to system
- `GET /api/songs/search` ‚Üí Search with criteria
- `PUT /api/songs/:id/rating` ‚Üí Rate a song

#### **playlists.ts**
- `GET /api/playlists/current` ‚Üí Get current playlist
- `PUT /api/playlists/sort` ‚Üí Sort playlist with algorithm choice
- `PUT /api/playlists/shuffle` ‚Üí Randomize playlist order

#### **playback.ts**
- `POST /api/playback/play` ‚Üí Start playing a song
- `POST /api/playback/next` ‚Üí Next song in playlist
- `GET /api/playback/history` ‚Üí Get play history

---

## üîÑ How Everything Works Together

### Example: Playing a Song
```
1. HTTP Request: POST /api/playback/play {"songId": "song1"}
2. Route Handler: playback.ts processes request
3. Engine Call: playWiseEngine.playSong("song1")
4. Data Structure Operations:
   - lookupEngine.getSong("song1") ‚Üí HashMap lookup O(1)
   - playbackHistoryEngine.addEntry() ‚Üí Stack push O(1)
   - Update current playing status
5. HTTP Response: Current song data + playing status
```

### Example: Getting Dashboard Analytics
```
1. HTTP Request: GET /api/dashboard
2. Route Handler: dashboard.ts processes request
3. Engine Call: playWiseEngine.getSystemStatus()
4. Dashboard Engine Aggregation:
   - Collect data from all 7 engines
   - Calculate statistics (O(n) operations)
   - Sort analytics data (O(n log n))
5. HTTP Response: Complete system snapshot
```

## üéØ Performance Characteristics

### Time Complexity Summary
| Operation | Complexity | Data Structure | Use Case |
|-----------|------------|----------------|----------|
| Add song to playlist | O(1) | DoublyLinkedList | Instant playlist updates |
| Find song by ID | O(1) avg | HashMap | Instant song lookup |
| Get songs by rating | O(log n) | BST | Rating-based queries |
| Sort playlist | O(n log n) | MergeSort/QuickSort | Ordered playback |
| Undo last play | O(1) | Stack | User-friendly interface |
| Track skipped songs | O(1) | Queue | Behavioral analytics |

### Space Complexity
- **Overall**: O(n) where n = number of songs
- **Lookup Engine**: O(3n) for multiple hash maps
- **Rating Engine**: O(n) for BST storage
- **History Engine**: O(h) where h = history limit
